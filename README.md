# 0x112

This is a de-obfuscated (via <https://obf-io.deobfuscate.io/>) and manually
refactored/commented version of the malicious payload introduced in the `color`
npm package and tons of others on September 8, 2025.

It has been split into multiple files and loosely ported to TypeScript for
additional semantic information.

Don't run this unless you want to funnel money to the attacker, obviously.
